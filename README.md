# Neuropixel Utils Jankification

This is a project management repo for Andrew Janke's 2021 project to enhance the [Neuropixel Utils](https://github.com/djoshea/neuropixel-utils) Matlab library.

This repo will contain work products, notes, project management stuff, and other things related to the project, but which are not going in to the repo fork for potential upstreaming.

This repo is mostly a GitHub Pages site. View it online at <https://npxutils-wip.apjanke.net/>.

The repo for this project's actual code is at <https://github.com/apjanke/npxutils-apj-wip-01>.

This project is supported by [MathWorks](https://mathworks.com).
