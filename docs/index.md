This is a project management repo for Andrew Janke's 2021 project to enhance the [Neuropixel Utils](https://github.com/djoshea/neuropixel-utils) Matlab library.

This repo will contain work products, notes, project management stuff, and other things related to the project, but which are not going in to the repo fork for potential upstreaming.

## Stuff in this repo

* [Changes](Changes.html) – Suggested changes I've made to the Neuropixel Utils repo.
* [Example Data](example-data.html) – Work on storing and sharing example data to go with Neuropixel Utils.
* [Questions](Questions.html) – Outstanding questions I have.
* [Notes](Notes.html) – Various notes
